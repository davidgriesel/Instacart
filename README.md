# Online Grocery Store
## Overview
An online grocery store that connects with customers through a mobile app aims to refine its marketing strategy through data-driven insights. By deepening their understanding into sales patterns and customer order behaviour, they seek to enhance customer segmentation and optimise marketing efforts.

## Use Case
Enhance marketing effectiveness through exploratory analysis of transactional and customer demographic data, generating insights to optimise advertisement scheduling, refine product placement, and improve customer segmentation to better align with purchasing behaviour.

## Key Questions 
### Order and Sales data

- Which days of the week, and hours of the day have the highest number of orders?
- Which time of day do customers spend the most?
- How can products be categorised into price ranges to support marketing strategies?
- Which product categories and departments have the highest order frequencies?

### Customer Profiling & Segmentation

- How do customer loyalty status and demographic factors such as age, income, family status, and region contribute to customer segmentation?
- How does ordering behaviour vary across customer profiles and demographic segments in terms of order price, order frequency, and product preferences?
- What is the relationship between age and family status, and does it have an impact on ordering habits? 

## Data

The dataset is provided as a spreadsheet with multiple tabs covering different aspects such as departments, aisles, orders, products, and more. It serves as the primary source for analysing sales patterns, product categorisation, and order volumes and frequencies.
